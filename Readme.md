Indlingo is an interactive, web-based language learning platform built to make learning Indian languages simple, engaging, and effective. The platform currently focuses on Kannada and Hindi, with a strong emphasis on practical understanding and active learning rather than rote memorization. Developed using modern web technologies like Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Supabase, Indlingo delivers a fast, scalable, and user-friendly experience. Users can easily sign up or log in using email and password authentication and choose the language they want to learn.

The learning flow is organized into structured lesson modules, each designed to gradually build vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. To keep learners engaged, Indlingo integrates gamification elements such as interactive quizzes and progress-based learning, encouraging consistency and motivation.

Quizzes play a core role in the platform and are designed to test real understanding. Users encounter a variety of question types, including:

• Multiple-choice questions

• Fill-in-the-blank exercises

These interactive assessments help reinforce concepts and provide immediate feedback, making the learning process more effective and enjoyable.

Supabase is used for backend services, including authentication, data storage, and real-time interactions, ensuring smooth performance and secure user data handling. The overall architecture is built with scalability in mind, allowing easy expansion to support additional Indian languages and advanced learning features in the future.

Indlingo aims to bridge the gap between technology and regional language education by offering a modern, accessible platform tailored for learners in India and beyond.
